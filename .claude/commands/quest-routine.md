# Quest Routine Generator

Create a PAB routine file from an Old School RuneScape wiki quest URL.

**Usage:** `/quest-routine <wiki-url>`

**Example:** `/quest-routine https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Song_of_the_Elves`

This command will:

1. **Extract quest requirements** from the provided wiki URL
2. **Recursively fetch all prerequisite quest requirements** by following the quest dependency chain
3. **Check against PAB capabilities** by examining `capabilities/quests.ts` to verify which quests are supported and their parameters
4. **Use fuzzy matching** to find quests in PAB capabilities by:
   - Converting wiki quest names to PAB format (removing apostrophes, converting spaces to underscores, uppercase)
   - Example: "Icthlarin's Little Helper" â†’ "ICTHLARINS_LITTLE_HELPER"
   - Matching similar quest names when exact matches fail
5. **Generate a complete routine file** with:
   - All skill requirements with target levels
   - Complete quest dependency chain in proper order
   - Combat preparation notes
   - Special requirements and items needed
   - **Comments out truly unsupported quests** with clear "NOT YET SUPPORTED IN PAB" notes
   - Proper quest parameters where specified in quests.ts

The generated routine will be saved as `routines/{quest-name}.r` with proper PAB task syntax.

**Target URL:** $ARGUMENTS

Process the quest at the provided wiki URL and create a comprehensive routine file following PAB conventions.
